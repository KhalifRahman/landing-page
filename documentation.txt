I'm using a Nuxt 4 directory structure while maintaining the Nuxt 3 for the rest of it. 

Using 4 modules: tailwindcss, google-fonts, nuxt icon, nuxt image.

And 2 plugins: tailwindcss-intersect, tailwindcss-motion. Mainly for the style.

There are 6 components: 
- Herosection.vue = The start of the page.
- Aboutme.vue = About who is Khalif Rahman, what I studied at school, what skills am I have right now.
- Project.vue = What projects that currently being worked on.
- Footer.vue = The footer of the web.
- Comingsoon.vue = Coming soon page from the projects.

Each of components have some props:
- Herosection.vue = [
        title="Khalif Rahman"
        subtitle="Back-End Developer"
        ctaText="More about me"
        ctaLink="#about-me"]

- Aboutme.vue = [
        id="about-me"
        name="Khalif Rahman"
        :image="khalifImage"
        description="
        school=""
        :details="[]"
        :skills-description="[]"
        :schoolImage="smkImage"
        :skillsImage="skillImage"
]

- Project.vue = [
        :projectLink1="projectLink1"
        :projectImage1="projectImage1"
        :projectTitle1="projectTitle1"
        :projectDescription1="projectDescription1"
        :projectLink2="projectLink2"
        :projectImage2="projectImage2"
        :projectTitle2="projectTitle2"
        :projectDescription2="projectDescription2"
] // With the help of javascript for the import image from assets folder
